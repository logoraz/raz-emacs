Modular Emacs Configuration set up specifically for Guix System Distribution...

This is a work in progress and is subject to change as I continue to work on my setup
and optimize my Emacs configuration.

This is set up to be used as Guix as a package that can be configured seperate to
my Guix configuration. It can then be pulled in my setup via a Guix service,
namely `home-raz-emacs-service-type`, see my `dotfiles` repo for more information.
